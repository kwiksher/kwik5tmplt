<!-- Initializes mermaid js.
     Main reason to use .init rather than .initialize is that .init allows to pass in a class selector.
     Hugo's markdown code fences ```mermaid ``` will create a html code block with class .language-mermaid.
     This can then be used by mermaid to generate the correct diagrams with code fences
-->
<script>
	mermaid.init(undefined, ".language-mermaid");
</script>
